1. What was printed in line 9 was 20. There was no error.
2. What was printed in line 13 was 20 and there was an error. Since the keyword var holds on the value regardless of the block, it was altered to have 20 in line 9. The value stored in var didn't change so, in line 13 the same output was outputted out, which was 20.
3.Line 9 printed 20, no error.
4.There was an error in line 13 because the let variable declated only lives within the block scope it's provided so it can't be accessed outside of the if statement, even though it's within the function itself.
5. There was an error in line 9, because const doesn't let variables be reassigned, line 9 could reassign the variable result. The program exited with an error code.
6. Since the program existed with an exit code in question 5, this line couldn't possibly be ran because it wasn't allowed to get there. Even however it was, the same reason in questoin 5 would apply to question 6. Because you can't change/reassign constants.
